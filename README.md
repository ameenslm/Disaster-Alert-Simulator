# Disaster Alert Simulator

A simple Python program that simulates disaster alerts. Users can generate alerts for different disaster types, view saved alerts, and save new alerts to a file.

## Features
- Generate disaster alerts for events like floods, landslides, cyclones, fires, and earthquakes.
- Save alerts to a `saved_alerts.txt` file.
- View previously saved alerts.

## How It Works
1. The program displays a menu with options to:
   - Generate a disaster alert.
   - View saved alerts.
   - Exit the program.
2. Users provide input for the disaster location and type.
3. The program validates input and generates an alert message.
4. Users can choose to save the alert or discard it.
